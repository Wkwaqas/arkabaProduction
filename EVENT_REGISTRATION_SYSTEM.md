## Integration Points

2. **User Authentication**: Detects user role for pricing
3. **Stripe Payments**: Processes payments for paid events
4. **Email System**: Ready for confirmation emails (template support)
5. **Dashboard**: Full admin interface for management

## Pricing Logic

```javascript
// User sees pricing based on their role
const userRole = session?.user?.role || "nonMember";
const price = eventRegistration.pricing[userRole];

// Non-members see prompt to sign in for better pricing
if (!session) {
  // Show "Sign in for member pricing" notice
}
```

## Registration Flow

1. User clicks "Register Now" on event
2. System loads registration page with event details
3. If not signed in, shows non-member pricing + sign-in prompt
4. If signed in, shows member pricing based on role
5. User fills out registration form
6. For paid events: Stripe payment processing
7. For free events: Immediate confirmation
8. Registration record created with appropriate status
9. Attendee count updated
